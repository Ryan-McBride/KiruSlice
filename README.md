# KiruSlice
CutSlice or SliceSlice I guess.

It's a batch file where if you drag a video file onto it, it'll slice it up into individual scenes.

It's relatively accurate but not perfect. 

You'll likely get some extra unrelated frames at the very end of the clips.

But you'll also get a nice big folder of video files that you can thumb through and find cool scenes.

It's like a shotgun approach to getting clips. Clip 'em all and let god (You) Sort em out.

The possibilities are limitless.
